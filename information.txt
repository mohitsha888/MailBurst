Explanation:
/mailburst/: This is the Django project directory, containing settings and project-wide configurations.
settings/: Contains different settings files for different environments.
urls.py: Main URL configuration for the project.
/apps/: Contains Django apps, each with its own functionality:
/core/: General utilities or shared logic.
/emails/: Handles email functionalities like sending, scheduling, and templates.
tasks.py: For integrating with a task scheduler like Celery if needed for asynchronous tasks.
/accounts/: Manages user authentication, registration, etc.
/static/: For static files:
/css/: CSS files for styling.
/js/: JavaScript if you need minimal scripting.
/templates/: HTML templates:
base.html: Base template for inheriting common elements across pages.
Each app has its own template folder for app-specific HTML.
/media/: For user-uploaded media files, if any (like email attachments).
manage.py: Django's command-line utility for administrative tasks.
requirements.txt: Lists all Python libraries needed for the project.
.gitignore: To exclude unnecessary files from version control.
README.md: Documentation for the project setup, usage, etc.

Notes:
Use Django's built-in authentication system for user management in the /accounts/ app.
For email functionalities, leverage Django's email sending capabilities or integrate with external SMTP services directly from your views or tasks.
The CSS in /static/css/ would be linked to in your HTML templates for styling.
If you decide to use a database, Django will create a /db.sqlite3 in the project root by default, but for production, you'd configure an external database in settings.py.
